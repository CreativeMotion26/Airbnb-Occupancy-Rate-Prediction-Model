## **Airbnb Occupancy Rate Prediction Model**

**Introduction**

In this project, it aims to predict the occupancy rate of Airbnb listings using machine learning regression techniques. This will allow us to estimate how often a property will be booked based on its attributes such as price, location and avilability.

**Steps for Solving a Regression Problem:**

* Find a suitable dataset: Use Airbnbâ€™s calendar dataset and listings dataset.* 
* Data Preparation: This includes cleaning up and transforming the data to make it suitable for model training.
* Feature Engineering: extract relevant features and calculate the target variable (occupancy rate).
* Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Model Training: Train the regressor using machine learning algorithms.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
* Prediction Results: Use the model to predict occupancy rates for new or unseen listings.
